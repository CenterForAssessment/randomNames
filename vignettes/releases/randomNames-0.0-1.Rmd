This is the initial release of the **randomNames** package. The **randomNames** package was developed to avoid always naming anonymous persons *John Doe* or *Jane Doe*.
Random names generated from the `randomNames` function are derived from a large data base of personal names with gender and ethnicity identifiers. The names are
also probabilistically selected based upon their frequency in the original data from which they were derived.

```{r}
library(randomNames)
randomNames(5)
```
