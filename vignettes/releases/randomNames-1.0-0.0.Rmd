This is 1.0 release of the **randomNames** package. This release is mostly about the creation of vignettes and
[web-documentation](https://CenterForAssessment.github.io/randomNames) for the package. However, the package now
also support Middle Eastern/Arab names. See the new [Getting Started Vignette](https://centerforassessment.github.io/randomNames/articles/randomNames.html)
for more information.
