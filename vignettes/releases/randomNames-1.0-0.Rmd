```


We're pleased to announce the first release of the **randomNames** package. The package isn't availabe on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomNames)
yet so you'll need to install it off of GitHub.

```
devtools::install_github("centerforassessment/randomNames")
```

Thereâ€™s not much to the **randomNames** package: Just a single function `randomNames`.

```r
library(randomNames)
print(randomNames(5))
```

You can see the documentation for more info on the `randomNames` arguments.

**randomNames** is under active development.
